As of 22/7/2018 each generate is generating cyphered values.
But the L3 pipe in the "piccoloenc" is producing wrong values.

As of 2/8/2018 
Have figured out the problem , the problem was due to wrong matrix logic , Matrix 
logic is updated , still matrix file has some syntax errors.
Matrix is solved using by Galois field method.
Also made slight changes in wk and rk files.
